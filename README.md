# Fake-News-NLP
The git repository contains the code relevant to the fake news challenges report. The "fakenws_classifiaction.py" could directy
run in Spyder. It will output the MLP's best score on test data. However, the process of training MLP will spend a lot of time, you could
also looad the model I have trained before. They are saved in the trained_model file.
