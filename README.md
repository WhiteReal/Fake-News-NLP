# Fake-News-NLP
The git repository contains the code relevant to the fake news challenges report. The "fakenws_classifiaction.py" could directy run in Spyder. It will output the MLP's best score on test data. However, the process of training MLP will spend 
a lot of time, you could also looad the model I have trained before. They are saved in the trained_model file. Meanwhile,
the baseline system (logistical regression) could also run in fakenws_classifiaction.py", I have added the annotations in it.
